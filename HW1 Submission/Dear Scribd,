Dear Scribd,

My name is Muhammad Khadafi and I'm writing to show my interest on joining Scribd for a summer internship. I am currently a Master of Science in Information Systems (Connective Media) candidate at Cornell Tech, a joint graduate degree from Cornell University and Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. I will be having my summer vacation from mid-May until end of August, in which I will be available for the internship.

Throughout my first year in Cornell Tech, the courses that I have taken are:
- Building Startup Systems
- Modern Analytics
- Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing
- Psychological and Sociological impacts of Social Media
- Human Computer Interaction
- User Experience Research
- Introduction to Connective Media
- Computer Vision
Combined with the traditional Computer Science bachelor's degree I've received from Nanyang Technological University and four year work experience on builing Flash and iOS game, I believe I have adequate experience to bring significant contribution for Scribd.

Some projects that I can share:
- Improviso (http://gambit.mit.edu/loadgame/improviso.php) - I computer game aimed to aid an AI research. Powered by Torque game engine
- Earth Girl (earthgirlgame.com) - An adventure flash game that raises awarness of natural disasters. Powered by Flixel
- Earth Girl 2 (earthgirl2.com) - A strategy iOS game that teaches people about disaster preparation. Powered by Objective-C and Unity game engine (C#)
- Around The World (https://github.com/mhdkhadafi/Around-The-World) - A food journaling Android app, using gamification to incentivize healty eating with food from around the world. Powered by Android SDK and MEAN stack as back end
- Tech-Conn (https://github.com/mhdkhadafi/tech-conn) - A web app for Cornell Tech's career managements to connect students fith faculties' connections. Powered by Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and PostgreSQL
And some other small projects you can see on https://github.com/mhdkhadafi

I an most interested right now is in working with web, as I would like to gain more knowledge in that. However, I also think that I had more experience in the Android platform. I would be happy working in whichever.

Scribd is a very innovative company. When I think about where I would like to contribute during my summer, I think about the product that I am a fan of, and I have been using Scribd extensively since moving to the USA a year ago. Please let me know if there is an opportunity for me to contribure further. Thank you very much.

Regards,
Muhammad Khadafi
